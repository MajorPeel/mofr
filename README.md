# MOFR – Modular Open Fitness Rounds

Welcome to **MOFR**, a fully open-source fitness format based on modular workout rounds. It’s designed for accessibility, portability, and community-driven evolution.

Each MOFR event consists of a series of fitness **stations** separated by **traverse segments** (usually runs). Events are easy to set up in public or private spaces and require minimal or no special equipment.

## 🔩 Core Concepts

* **Modular**: Choose from a growing library of stations and combine them freely
* **Open**: Anyone can host or participate — no license, no paywall
* **Fitness Rounds**: Alternating between short cardio traverses and functional exercises

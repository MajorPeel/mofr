# Equipment Specification: MOFR Standard Medicine Ball

Participants are expected to bring their own medicine ball for MOFR events. Balls may be of any construction or brand but must meet the following specifications to ensure consistency and fairness across formats.

## Weight Options

The following medicine ball weights are used based on participant category:

- **4kg** – for **Youth** and **Women's** categories
- **6kg** – for **Women's Pro** and **Open** categories
- **9kg** – for **Open Pro** category

> ⚠️ The ball must weigh **at least** the minimum for the participant’s category. Heavier balls may be used but will not provide scoring advantages.

## Design Guidelines

- Medicine balls can be rubber, vinyl, fabric-filled, or hybrid.
- Must be **safe to throw, slam, carry, and catch**.
- Balls with **internal shifting weight (e.g., slam balls)** are allowed.
- **No rigid or metal-core balls** allowed due to safety risk.

## Participant Identification

- The ball must be clearly marked with the **participant’s name**.
- Label should be visible and durable (permanent marker or adhesive label).

## Size and Handling

- No strict size standard; however:
  - Ball must be manageable for functional movement
  - Should not have grips, handles, or unusual attachments

> Typical commercial sizes (for guidance):
> - 4kg: ~25cm diameter  
> - 6kg: ~28cm diameter  
> - 9kg: ~30–32cm diameter

## DIY and Alternative Options

- DIY medicine balls (e.g., basketballs filled with sand or rice and sealed) are allowed if they meet the weight and safety criteria.
- Participants are responsible for ensuring ball durability and event readiness.

## Enforcement

- Organizers may inspect or weigh balls at check-in.
- Non-compliant balls may result in disqualification or adjusted scoring.

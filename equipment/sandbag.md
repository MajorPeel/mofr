# Equipment Specification: MOFR Standard Sandbag

Participants are expected to bring their own sandbag for MOFR events. While design and construction may vary, all sandbags must meet the following standards to ensure fairness and safety.

## Weight Options

The following weights are permitted depending on category:

- **10kg** – for **Youth** and **Women's** categories
- **20kg** – for **Women's Pro** and **Open** categories
- **30kg** – for **Open Pro** category

> ⚠️ The sandbag must weigh **at least** the minimum weight for the selected category. Heavier bags may be used but offer no competitive advantage.

## Design Guidelines

- **Any design is permitted** as long as it meets the weight and safety requirements.
- The bag must be **soft-shelled** and safe to shoulder, drop, and carry.
- **Oversized or rigid handles are not permitted**, as they provide an unfair advantage.

## Participant Identification

- Each sandbag must be clearly labeled with the **participant's name**.
- Label must be visible during use, using marker or securely affixed tag.

## Shape and Size

- Should be generally cylindrical, duffel-style, or similarly shaped for fair carry mechanics.
- Must be **large enough to prevent sprinting comfortably** but not so large as to hinder safety.
- Recommended approximate length: **50–70 cm**

## Alternative and DIY Options

- DIY options are acceptable, such as:
  - A heavy-duty duffel bag filled with sealed filler bags (e.g., sand, gravel).
  - Commercially available fitness sandbags.

## Enforcement

- Organizers may weigh or inspect sandbags at the start of an event.
- Non-compliant sandbags may result in disqualification or adjusted results.

This standard ensures fairness while maintaining MOFR’s principles of accessibility, adaptability, and low barrier to entry.

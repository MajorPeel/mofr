# Traverse: Running

Running is the default method of moving between MOFR stations.

## Standard Distance

- **1 km** between each station
- Total: 8 km over 8 rounds

## Course Options

- Out-and-back loops
- Track circuits
- Park paths
- Indoor treadmills (if necessary)

## Timing

- Running segments are timed as part of the total workout
- No mandatory rest periods between runs or stations

## Variations

You may substitute other traverse methods (e.g., cycling, rowing, rucking) depending on event goals. These should be defined in `/traverse/` as alternatives.

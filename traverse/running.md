# Traverse: Running

Running is a simple and effective method of moving between stations in a MOFR event. It provides a scalable cardio challenge and integrates easily into outdoor or indoor setups.

## Setup

- The route should be clearly marked and safe for participants.
- Surfaces should be stable and free of obstacles.
- The total distance is specified in the header.

## Rules

- Participants must cover the full distance as specified in the header.
- Any running style is permitted (e.g., jogging, sprinting), but walking or resting adds to the total time.
- Cutting or shortening the route results in disqualification.

## Scaling

- Distances can be adjusted for youth events, scaled formats, or adaptive athletes.
